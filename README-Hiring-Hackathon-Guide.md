# Hiring-Hackathon-Guide for 8/24-8/31


## Objective 
You can build any game you'd like. Whether it's Tetris, Super Mario, Civilization, Diablo, Slime Volleyball (remember that?), or just a ball bouncing around on a screen, as long as it sticks to the following requirements:

- Your game has to be 2D. Isometric view is OK as long as there are only 2 dimensions that your character can move in.
- Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, beating the boss monster.
- Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, losing all your lives.
- Your game's frontend must be built in JavaScript or Typescript.
- You can only use packages that you can download off NPM, and you cannot use professional game engines like Unreal, Unity or Godot. (If in doubt, ask)
- Your application must have a clear landing page. See the Hiring Hackathon Guide for more info

## For Full-Stack Applications

- You DON'T need authentication (sign in / sign out)
- But there must be some meaningful reason for the backend to exist. For example, tracking the player's own score or points (easy), or having a leaderboard (medium), or having multiplayer (hard).
- All of the requirements for Frontend apps apply.

## Backend

- Since this is a 2D game, there is no backend-only challenge. Instead, build a frontend or full stack app, or pair up with a frontend developer and build a full stack application
